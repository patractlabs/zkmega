# Megaclite

Megaclite is a zero-knowledge proof tool set building for the Polkadot ecology. 

## Curves

Here we provide `alt_bn128` and `bls12_381` curves for ZKP, both of them contain `Integrate addition`, 
`Scalar multiplication` and `Pairing` functions, for helping devlopers trying and testing the curves, 
we provide `groth16` for verifaction as well.
