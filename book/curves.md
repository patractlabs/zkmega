# Curves

> In Progress

Here we provide [alt\_bn128][alt_bn128] and [bls12\_381][bls12_381] curves for ZKP, both of 
them contain `Integrate addition`, `Scalar multiplication` and `Pairing` functions, for helping 
devlopers trying and testing the curves, we provide [groth16][groth16] for verifaction as well.
